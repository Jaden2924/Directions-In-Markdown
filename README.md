# How to Shoot a Basketball
---
> There are plenty of tricks and techniques to understand the basic and even more complex principles to improve your basketball form. But, in the end, there is no better tool than practice and muscle memory, the key to great shooting is consistency.

### Materials
A basketball
A hoop (optional but very useful)
An outdoor space or a high ceilinged room

## B.E.E.F. (Balance, Elbow, Eyes, Follow Through)
> Beef is an acronym to help you get started and remember how to shoot effectively.

-Balance
: People often worry about not reaching the basket but with proper balance and techniques, it's less than effortless. Your body should be facing the basket with your feet shoulder-length apart. When shooting bend your knees and jump releasing the ball at the top of your jump.

-Elbow
: Your shooting or dominant hand should be on the bottom of the ball and your off or guide hand should be placed on the side. The key here is to keep your dominant arm's elbow directly under the ball during the entire shooting process.

-Eyes
: A seemingly obvious but still difficult part is keeping your eyes on the basket, which is only exponentially harder when a defender is rushing you. Eyes on the basket and aim for the back of the rim or the top of the front of the basket.

-Follow Through
: Once the ball is being released an often rushed factor is your follow through. As the ball is leaving your hands flick your shooting hand forward making a goose's neck and hold that position until landing. Holding this position helps improve the flicking motion of your shot and overall accuracy.  

## Doing
> With the basic principles down we can start shooting!

![Shooting Process](https://github.com/Jaden2924/Directions-In-Markdown/blob/main/Silhouette.jpg)

1. Face the Basket
2. Place your feet (think back to balance)
3. Bend your knees and prepare to jump (this should be a fairly short jump a tiny bit forwards)
4. As you are jumping bring the ball up toward in front of your forehead (remember eyes on the basket and elbow under the ball)
5. Once you reach the peak of your jump extend your arms upward and flick your hand forward as your arms finish extending (use your fingers when flicking **not your palms or thumbs**)
6. Shoot the ball in arc between ~55 and ~70 degrees I suggest the higher end
7. Hold your arms in the position they were in when you finished shooting until you land

### Closing
> No one becomes MJ in a day.

Things like this take persistence and practice, watching yourself, others, or having a friend watch you shoot are great ways to practice. Drills like one handed shooting up close and free throws are good ways to improve and cement your form. Everyone's shot may look a little different, but following these general rules will improve your shot no doubt!
